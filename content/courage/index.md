Render of the house/farm from the cartoon Courage
the Cowardly Dog

![Courage render](/couragerender.png)

Ground texture was a real life photo taken from the Painted Hills
in Oregon. I turned that picture into a seamless texture for
use in this scene

Roof texture was made with a noise texture and then stretching
and coloring that noise texture with a color ramp to look like a wood grain.
